# SemanticSearch #

This project is made for teaching purposes as assignment of the semantic web exam at Universidad de Murcia

# Assignment # 

The students must develop a basic search engine for semantic web content related to the domain of the ontology they have developed in previous assignments. For this purpose, the students will need to develop a query interface through which the user will input some text. The system will then search for the input text in the most appropriate annotation or properties of the semantic resources. The set of semantic resources will include:

* The ontology developed in previous assignments.
* DBPedia
* Linked Data resources with SPARQL Endpoints

The search process will classify the results in two categories: classes and properties. The classes will contain both the classes and the individuals, whereas the properties will contain both data and object properties.
